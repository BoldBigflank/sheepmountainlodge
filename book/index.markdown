                Sheep Mountain Lodge is located one mile off Interstate 90, between Superior and St. Regis, Montana, on the Clark Fork River. Take the Dry Creek exit, turn towards the river, head west on the frontage road before the river about one mile, and then turn right onto the driveway and follow it for about a half-mile to the lodge.
